## Web Development
Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, per the owner's requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding and writing markup. Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex web-based applications, social network applications and electronic business applications.

- What can I build?
  - Websites
  - Web Applications
  - Native Applications (Mobile)

- What is the differnt between front-end vs back-end?
  - Front-end (HTML, CSS, JS) markup and programming languages are used to structure, style and make the user interface.
  - Back-end (Ruby, Python, etc.) programming langauges are used to process data on the server side and return information requested by the user interface.

- What do programs actually do?
  - Keep track of values (variables).
  - Make decisions (conditionals).
  - Repeat things (loops).
  - Log things (log files).
  - Store things (databases).

- What are the stages of web development?
  - Agile vs. Waterfall
  - Waterfall is a sequential design process. goes through each of the eight stages, conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, implementation, and maintenance.
  - Agile is development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It does not deliver the product all at once near the end.

- What are the stages of the design?
  - User experience includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency.
  - Infomation architecture includes reasearching the audience and business, analyzing data, and developing site structures.
  - Visual design focuses on the aesthetics of a site and its related materials by strategically implementing images, colors, fonts, and other elements.

- What is version control?
  - Keeps trackof code and versions.
  - Keeps track of contributions.
  - Collaborate with others on.
  - Open source, denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

## Website Preparation (10min)
