## Website Preparation (10min)
In order to build and deploy a website or web application, you will need certain requirements. Today, we will be using Google Chrome as our browser and Sublime Text as our editor. If you are unable to install Sublime Text due to having a work computer or anything else, let us know! You may need to use the default text editor.

###### Requirements
- A computer (Acer, Dell, Lenova, MacBook, Surface Pro, etc.).
- A web browser ([Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48126), [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie), [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari), and [Opera](http://www.opera.com/)).
- A text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/), Notepad, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), and TextEdit).

###### Deployment
- A FTP client ([Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), [SmartFTP](https://www.smartftp.com/), and [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/)).
- A domain name (assigning addresses to internet web servers).
- A host (serves the pages for one or more websites).
- We will be using [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/)! It's free!

## Hyper Text Markup Language (1hr)
HTML is a markup language for describing webpages. For example, let's visit the Google website! We will be using the developer tools to inspect the webpage. At the end of the day, a wesbite is just content!

- Display elements in the developer tools.
- Let's create a rudimentary website! Add your own content and have fun!
- As we go, add different elements we will be using throughout the class.
- Markup language is a set of markup tags.
- HTML tags describes different document content (important with SEO).
- HTML documents are described by HTML tags.

```html
<tagname>content</tagname>
```

- HTML tags usually come in pairs.
- The first tag is the start (opening) tag, the second tag is the end (closing) tag.
- The end (closing) tag is written with a slash before the tag name.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` describes an HTML document.
- `<html></html>` defines the document type.
- `<head></head>` is the information about the document
- `<title></title>` is the title of the document.
- `<body></body>` contains visible content.
